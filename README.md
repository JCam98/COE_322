# Infectious Disease Simulation Project


## Description

This README file contains instructions on how to build executables from main programs and library used in exercises 1-5 for the Infectious Disease Simulation Project.

## User Guide for Executing Simulations

1) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Disease_Exercise_1.cc`: 

- Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Exercise_1.o`  created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Disease_Exercise_1.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o` created by compiling the header entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.h` which contains the `Person` and `Population` class definitions. 

2) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.cc`:

-Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.o` created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o`
